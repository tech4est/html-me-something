                <h2>Joining a Channel</h2>
                <p>During each unit of LC101, participants will be grouped with a new teaching fellow for in-class assignment discussion and completion. Joining a teaching fellow's Slack channel is a good way to ask questions of the teaching fellow, share helpful links with classmates, and troubleshoot problems that others might encounter.</p>
                <p>How to join a channel in Slack:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>On the navigation menu at the left of the screen, click <strong>Channels</strong>, which will open the <strong>Browse channels</strong> searchable list.<br/>
                    <img src="images/channels.png" alt="Channels"></li>
                    <li>Type the first few letters of the group you would like to join to reveal a list of matching channels.<br/>
                        <img src="images/type_name.png" alt="Type channel name"></li>
                    <li>Click the name of the channel you wish to join.<br/>
                        <img src="images/click_channel.png" alt="Click channel"></li>
                    <li>At the bottom of the screen, click the <strong>Join Channel</strong> button.<br/>
                        <img src="images/join_channel.png" alt="Click Join Channel"></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Now you are ready send a message to members of the channel.</p>


                <h2>Creating a Discussion Thread</h2>
                <p>Now that you have joined channels, you should learn how to respond to others using message threads. Multiple people can have multiple conversations simultaneously, so using threads nests relevant responses beneath the original message. This approach will help you to better organize discussions and avoid confusion when there are replies to several topics.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Hover over a message you would like to respond to, which will reveal four useful icons.</li> 
                    <li>Click the <strong>Start a thread</strong> icon.<br/>
                    <img src="images/start_thread.png" alt="Start a thread"></li>
                    <li>Compose a response to the message you have chosen, and then click <strong>Send</strong><br/>
                        <img src="images/send_thread.png" alt="Respond and send a thread"><br/><em>Note: As with other messages, you can also include emojis.</em></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Notice how this threaded message and others like it are neatly organized beneath the original message, creating a clear flow of discussion. Other readers in the channel are more likely to see responses you post that would be relevant to the topic they are interested in viewing.</p>


                

                <h2>Uploading a Code Snippet</h2>
                <p>Some additional information here.</p>
           
        
        </article>
        <p>Does each of the following:
                
                Uses each of the following structural HTML5 tags: <p>, <header>, <footer>, <main>, <article>. If you need to brush up on what each of these tags is used for, or if any of them are new to you, check out the HTML tag reference at w3schools.
                
                Uses at least one <img> tag (and hopefully more). When placing images in your page, put them in a new subfolder called images within your html-me-something directory.
                
                Uses at least one HTML entity. Hint: putting a copyright notice in your footer will afford you the opportunity to use &copy;, but you should also try to get creative here.
                
                Is creative. Don't stop with these items or tags. Have some ideas for your page, and make it great. And dig into the w3schools HTML reference to learn more about other tags, their usage and attributes!
                Notes and Tips
                Use your browser developer tools to look at the example page, or to troubleshoot things that don't look right. You can mimic the document structure of this example, but do not just copy/paste! Use the example to learn how your HTML elements might be structured, and structure your own page according to your own content's needs.
                Don't add any CSS yet. Really, we mean it! If you think your page looks boring now, that's okay. We'll get there soon enough.
                As you make changes, you will obviously want to see the results. To do so, simply re-save the file in your text editor, and then, over in your browser window, click Refresh (or use cmd+R on a Mac, ctrl+R on Windows).
                Rely on reference sites linked on this page, and elsewhere online. We haven't taught you every detail about every tag that you may want or need to use, and you're free to use tags that haven't been explicitly introduced in class. We've given you enough background to get started, and are intentionally leaving some of the learning up to you.
                Add and Commit Your Changes on Git
                Once you are finished, use Git once again to add and commit your index.html changes.</p>
