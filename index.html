                <h2>Joining a Channel</h2>
                <p>During each unit of LC101, participants will be grouped with a new teaching fellow for in-class assignment discussion and completion. Joining a teaching fellow's Slack channel is a good way to ask questions of the teaching fellow, share helpful links with classmates, and troubleshoot problems that others might encounter.</p>

        <p>Does each of the following:
                
                Uses each of the following structural HTML5 tags: <p>, <header>, <footer>, <main>, <article>. If you need to brush up on what each of these tags is used for, or if any of them are new to you, check out the HTML tag reference at w3schools.
                
                Uses at least one <img> tag (and hopefully more). When placing images in your page, put them in a new subfolder called images within your html-me-something directory.
                
                Uses at least one HTML entity. Hint: putting a copyright notice in your footer will afford you the opportunity to use &copy;, but you should also try to get creative here.
                
                Is creative. Don't stop with these items or tags. Have some ideas for your page, and make it great. And dig into the w3schools HTML reference to learn more about other tags, their usage and attributes!
                Notes and Tips
                Use your browser developer tools to look at the example page, or to troubleshoot things that don't look right. You can mimic the document structure of this example, but do not just copy/paste! Use the example to learn how your HTML elements might be structured, and structure your own page according to your own content's needs.
                Don't add any CSS yet. Really, we mean it! If you think your page looks boring now, that's okay. We'll get there soon enough.
                As you make changes, you will obviously want to see the results. To do so, simply re-save the file in your text editor, and then, over in your browser window, click Refresh (or use cmd+R on a Mac, ctrl+R on Windows).
                Rely on reference sites linked on this page, and elsewhere online. We haven't taught you every detail about every tag that you may want or need to use, and you're free to use tags that haven't been explicitly introduced in class. We've given you enough background to get started, and are intentionally leaving some of the learning up to you.
                Add and Commit Your Changes on Git
                Once you are finished, use Git once again to add and commit your index.html changes.</p>
